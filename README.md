Developing ontology about sustainable cities SDG GOAL11

Sustainable Cities Ontology

==============
##  Motivation

Cities are growing with unseen rate, providing better Since we live in a dynamic world, the problem of movement becomes more acute. Not everyone wants to use public transport and prefer cars or scooters. For better use of resources and comfortable movement, you can use the car rental network. Therefore, my partner and I decided to develop an ontology for car rental, which will be relevant for service owners to better organize their work.
